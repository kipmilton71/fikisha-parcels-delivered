# 🚀 Production Setup Guide for Fikisha Delivery Website

## ✅ Fixed for Production

The SQL script has been updated to be **production-ready** for your real company website. The foreign key error has been resolved.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ❌ **Previous Issue:**
- Sample data with hardcoded UUIDs that don't exist in `auth.users`
- Foreign key constraint violations
- Not suitable for production

### ✅ **Fixed Version:**
- **No sample data** - Clean production database
- **Automatic profile creation** - Profiles created when users sign up
- **Real user authentication** - Works with actual Supabase Auth
- **Production-ready** - Suitable for your company website

## 📋 Production Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run the Fixed SQL Script

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the contents of `supabase_setup.sql`**
4. **Click "Run"**

The script will now:
- ✅ Create all necessary tables and types
- ✅ Set up Row Level Security policies
- ✅ Create automatic profile creation trigger
- ✅ **No sample data** - Clean production database

### Step 2: Configure Authentication

1. **Go to Authentication → Settings**
2. **Enable Email authentication**
3. **Configure your site URL** (your website domain)
4. **Set up email templates** (optional)

### Step 3: Connect Your Frontend

1. **Install Supabase client**:
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

2. **Get your credentials**:
   - Go to Settings → API
   - Copy Project URL
   - Copy anon/public key

3. **Update the real client**:
   - Open `src/integrations/supabase/real-client.ts`
   - Replace `SUPABASE_URL` with your project URL
   - Replace `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your anon key

4. **Switch to real client**:
   - Open `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
   - Change import from:
     ```typescript
     import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';
     ```
   - To:
     ```typescript
     import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/real-client';
     ```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### User Registration Flow:
1. **User signs up** through your website
2. **Supabase Auth** creates the user in `auth.users`
3. **Trigger automatically creates** profile in `profiles` table
4. **User gets role** (customer/driver) from signup form
5. **Profile is ready** for dashboard access

### Database Structure:
- **`auth.users`** - Supabase Auth users (managed automatically)
- **`profiles`** - User profiles (created automatically via trigger)
- **`driver_profiles`** - Driver-specific info (created when needed)
- **`orders`** - Delivery orders (created by users)
- **`order_tracking`** - Real-time tracking (created by drivers)
- **`notifications`** - User notifications (created by system)

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **Row Level Security** - Users only see their own data
- ✅ **Automatic profile creation** - No manual data entry needed
- ✅ **Role-based access** - Customers and drivers have different permissions
- ✅ **Secure authentication** - Handled by Supabase Auth
