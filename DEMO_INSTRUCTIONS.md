# 🚀 Fikisha Delivery Website - Demo Instructions

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your website is now fully functional with a **demo mode** that simulates a logged-in user! Here's what you can test:

### 🎯 **Demo Features**
- **Auto-Login**: You're automatically logged in as "Demo User"
- **Role-Based Dashboard**: Users see the dashboard for their specific role (Customer or Driver)
- **Working Logout**: Logout button works and redirects to landing page
- **Full Functionality**: All features work with mock data

### 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Start the Website**:
   ```bash
   cd fikisha-parcels-delivered
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **You'll be automatically logged in** as a demo user

3. **Test Customer Features** (Default):
   - Click "Create Order" to create a delivery
   - View order history and tracking
   - Find nearby drivers
   - **Test Logout**: Click the user menu in header → "Sign Out" → You'll be redirected to landing page

4. **Test Driver Features**:
   - Edit `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
   - Change `role: 'customer'` to `role: 'driver'` in both `mockUser` and `mockProfile`
   - Refresh the page to see the Driver dashboard
   - View available orders, accept orders, and manage deliveries
   - **Test Logout**: Click the user menu in header → "Sign Out" → You'll be redirected to landing page

5. **Test Logout Flow**:
   - When logged out, all buttons show "Login to..." instead of action buttons
   - Click any "Login to..." button to go back to authentication page
   - Sign in again to return to your dashboard

### 🔄 **Switching Between Roles**
- **To test Customer dashboard**: Set `role: 'customer'` in the mock data
- **To test Driver dashboard**: Set `role: 'driver'` in the mock data
